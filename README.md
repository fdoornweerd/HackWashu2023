For LinguaLink, we had 24 hours and wanted to create a platform to connect language learners across the world and our website is your passport to meet native speakers of any language.  We have modernized the concept of foreign pen pals and empowered users to learn together in a unique space where both users in a match can converse in their native language and the language they are eager to master. LinguaLink is your bridge to a diverse community of learners, each with their own unique stories and cultural backgrounds. It is no secret that the best way to learn a language is to see, speak, and hear the language in real conversations. Quizlet flashcards and duolingo lessons can only take you so far.  LinguaLink is the next step towards true mastery of a language.  It is cheaper, less formal, more interesting, and more convenient than professional lessons.  It is as simple as creating an account, choosing which recommended matches to pursue, and connecting with your matches through messages or calls.  Matches are based on the languages you and a partner are fluent in and trying to learn as well as interests and hobbies that can provide great conversation topics.
