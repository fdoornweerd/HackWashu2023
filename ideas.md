# Necessary
- Create account / sign in
- Profile creation
- Matching

# Nice to haves
- In app chat/call
- Different levels of users (novice, teacher etc...)
- Incentives:
 - Points/karma for doing more calls (Streaks?)
 - Money?? Could incorporate Mastercard API
- Duolingo API
- Resources for more help
- 

# TODO
- Fix Edit Profile (can essentially be copy of profile set up)
